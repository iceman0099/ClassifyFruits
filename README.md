# ClassifyFruits

Here, we are going to implement your first Machine Learning model by name K Nearest Neighbors. We are going to use the fruits_train dataset given for training and test your implementation using fruits_test data set.

If we need to normalize the data we can use from sklearn.preprocessing module.
